      <description>I used to use my monitor, a HP L2245w, only by using its VGA input because it was the only cable I had lying around. But some time ago, I had a project that required to use its DVI port and I bought the cable.
When hooking my PC to the monitor via DVI for the first time, I noticed that the resolution was really bad: 1024x768 was used even though my monitor supports 1680x1050 and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to select higher resolutions using xrandr without creating a custom profile.</description>
